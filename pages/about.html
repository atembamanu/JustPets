                    <h4>WHY PETS</h4>
                    <p>You can of course play and laugh with pets. They bring Joy and happiness.
                        They teach us how to let it go fast and move on. They got so much energy and healthy benefits.
                        <br>
                        <em>The benefits would include...</em>
                    </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col col-6">
                    <h5>They Keep You Fit</h5>
                    <p>All breeds of dog need regular, daily walks in order to stay happy and healthy,
                        and so do we! However, we sometimes have the tendency to get a bit lazy –
                        if that sounds like you, a dog is the perfect cure! They’ll be dragging you out the
                        front door and making you run around the park each and every day. Yes, a dog is
                        possibly the best personal trainer you could ask for.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col col-6">

                    <h5>They make sure you’re never lonely</h5>
                    <p>If you live by yourself, or your partner works different shift patterns to you,
                        it can get awfully lonely at home – unless you have a pet, of course! Cats and
                        dogs make great companions – they’ll always be waiting for you to come home and
                        they’ll be happy to lend an ear should you want to moan about the awful day
                        you’ve had. Plus, most of the time, they’re up for a snuggle on the sofa.</p>

                    <h5>They lower your stress levels</h5>
                    <p>Modern life is stressful and high levels of anxiety can lead to numerous
                        health problems. Luckily, pets can really help us relax – stroking your
                        cat or simply watching fish swim around in a tank can make your worries
                        melt away. Previous studies have proven that pet owners tend to have
                        lower blood pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride levels than people
                        who don’t own a pet. That means having a furry pal can decrease the
                        chances of suffering a heart attack later in life..</p>

                    <h5>They can help you make friends</h5>
                    <p>The pet owner community is an incredibly friendly one – you’ll often
                        find that people will stop to talk to you about your dog in the park.
                        Having a pet is a great way to meet new people and create bonds quickly,
                        especially if you’re not too good at small talk. You never know,
                        owning a dog may help you meet the love of your life!.</p>

                <div class="col col-6">
                    <h5>They can improve your immune system</h5>
                    <p>Pets spend a lot of their time outside and
                        therefore bring all sorts of dirt and germs
                        into your home. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing though –
                        the additional germs can help improve your immunity to colds
                        and other mild illnesses. In fact,
                        previous studies have shown that babies who live with a dog

                        tend to experience fewer infections and are generally healthier than those who don’t.</p>

                    <h5>They make you feel safe</h5>
                    <p>Not everyone likes being home alone, but having a cat or dog there can make you feel a lot safe
                        likely to target a house that’s clearly home to a dog. Some breeds make excellent
                        guard dogs and will even protect you when you’re out for a run or walk.</p>
